# APA7 (-ish) Template for Typst

[Typst](https://typst.app/) Template that (mostly) complies with APA7 Style (Work in Progress).

The template does not follow all recommendations by the APA Manual, especially when the suggestions break with typographic conventions (such as double line spacing :vomiting_face:). Instead, the goal of this template is that it generates you a high-quality manuscript that has all the important components of the APA7 format, but is aesthetically pleasing.

# Work in Progress

The following works already quite well:

- consistent and simple typesetting
- correct display of author information / author note
- citations and references

This is still not working:

- Page headers and footers (show short title in header)
- Tables: seeking to implement 3-part-tables (caption, content, and table notes)
- No indentation of first paragraphs after heading elements
- figures 
- complete pandoc integration (template for pandoc to replace Latex-based workflows)
- automatic calculation of page margins (like memoir-class for Latex)
