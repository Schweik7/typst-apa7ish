# APA7 (-ish) Template for Typst

[Typst](https://typst.app/) Template that (mostly) complies with APA7 Style (Work in Progress).

尝试为mrwunderbar666/typst-apa7ish的模板做一些完善
# Work in Progress

The following works already quite well:

- consistent and simple typesetting
- correct display of author information / author note
- citations and references

This is still not working:

- Page headers and footers (show short title in header)
- Tables: seeking to implement 3-part-tables (caption, content, and table notes)
- No indentation of first paragraphs after heading elements
- figures 
- complete pandoc integration (template for pandoc to replace Latex-based workflows)
- automatic calculation of page margins (like memoir-class for Latex)
